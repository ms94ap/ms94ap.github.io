				<h3>Why do you want to work here?</h3>
					<p>As my resume suggests I have a great track record in the area of sales in Hospitality industry and a recent degree on applied web development technologies, with a short working experience.  For me this position in Oxyma is a unique chance to combine all the knowledge and skills I have acquired through these years and I believe that my skills set can be proved useful and beneficial for the company as well.  I am really excited to be part of the different and multidisciplinary projects that the company is involved in and I believe that I can fit in the team and actively help the company to efficiently communicate between IT and marketing. At last, mastering my expertise in most recent web-development technologies is one of my greatest motivations and Oxyma offers an ideal working environment for that purpose.

				<h3>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
					<p> At this stage my goal is to gain working experience, learn new technologies and assist the team as soon as possible to achieve itâ€™s long and short term goals. My belief is that every project is a new experience and I look forward to learn the most out of every new challenge that I face. In five years time I would like to see myself as a senior software developer, able to run my own small team in the company and lead the way with my experience towards new projects and ideas.
