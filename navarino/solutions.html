		The solution to the SQL problem is as follows: <br><br>

		After running the queries below:

	
	<h3> General Table</h3>
		<div>CREATE TABLE general (</div>
	 	<div> id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,</div>
	 	<div> employee TEXT,</div>
	 	<div> salary INTEGER,</div>
	 	<div>department_id INTEGER</div>
		<div>);</div>

	 <h3>Department table</h3>
	 	<div>CREATE TABLE  department (</div>
	 	<div> id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,</div>
	 	<div> department TEXT</div>
	 	<div>);</div> <br>

	 	<div>It will produce the following tables:</div>
	 	<br>
	 	<img src="img/schema.png">
	 	<br><br>
	 	<div> Add some values to the Department table for the sake of the argument </div>
	 	<br>
	 	 <img src="img/dep.png">
	 	 <br><br>
	 	 <div>and to General table</div>
	 	 <br><br>
	 	 <img src="img/general.png">
	 	 <br><br>
	 	 <div> So, the query to get the maximum salary from each department with the employee name is:</div><br>

	 	 <h3>SELECT employee, MAX(salary), Department.department FROM General INNER JOIN Department <br>ON General.department_id = Department.id GROUP BY department; </h3>
	 	 <br><br>
	 	 In this query, I m selecting the employee column, the maximum value of the salary column from General table along with the department column <br>from Department table, I create an Inner Join with the Department table where I assign the foreign key (department_id column) equal  to <br>the value of the primary key of the Department table and Group the result by department

	 	 <div> and it will  produce the following table:</div>
