Finally the journey is over. Six months ago i had no clue what programming is. I honestly don't know what lies ahead but looking back I can definitely say this was one of the most rewarding things ever did in my life. Coming from a different industry can be very challenging. The first thing someone has to change is the way of thinking. During the course  I came across with Steve Job's statemement “Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”. And he was right. 
There were times that things didn't make any sense. When you reach this point the secret is to keep going. Maybe they didn't make any sense at that point now but later they did.
A journey is over and a new one starts. The very first thing I will do is to look over a few topics just to refresh. Also I will continue practicing on the apps I created and experiment but also create some new. I will also work on the main e-commerse app and add additional features.
